25,"<Face_1><Bal_0>And my only pleasure is for Goddess to bestow blessing on both you, Angelo, and of course also on <turnpl>."
26,"<Face_2><Bal_0>The only victory I'm looking for is to win the heart of a fair maiden like you, <turnpl>."

33,"<Face_5><Bal_0>I couldn't prey on the weak. It just isn't my style."
34,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Ain't no con sessions fer ladies round my neck o' the woods! So, er...watch yer back!"
35,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Bad luck. It looks like <turnpl> doesn't want to be bothered with child-minding."

40,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Awright then, Smiles, it's ‘fight wisely’, OK? No 'eroics, right. Just make sure <turnpl> don't win."
41,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Yessir, mister Yangus, sir! (slurp) ...But, what are ‘eroics’? Some kind of workout?"

45,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Well, well! A man who gets Jessica hot under the collar... This will be interesting."
46,"<Face_4><Bal_1>Jessica and <turnpl> at the same time! ...Phew! I couldn't choose between them. It wouldn't be fair to deny either of them."
47,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Why doesn't such a comment surprise me? A character like him could never just choose one person to support and stay faithful to them."
48,"<Face_3><Bal_1>I ain't about to lose to no slimeball! And I ain't about to lose to a slime, neither, <turnpl>! Heh heh!"

4558,"Luigi: Mario's twin brother. Though normally quiet and unassuming, he's a shrewd and powerful man."
4559,"Peach: Princess of Mushroom Kingdom, often kidnapped by the wicked Bowser. Although she lives a sheltered life, she's not afraid of a battle on Fortune Street!"
4560,"Yoshi: Mario's trusty adventuring partner who carries Mario around on the shell on his back. His long tongue's perfect for slurping up fruit and giving his adversaries a good licking, too!"
4561,"Bowser: Head of the Koopa Troop, whose sole aim seems to be disturbing the peace in Mushroom Kingdom. He's a dangerous business rival, who won't hesitate to buy your property from under you."
4562,"Toad: Never far from Princess Peach's side, Toad is here on Fortune Street too. He's a thoroughly nice Toad who's rooting for everyone!"
4563,"Donkey Kong: A soft-hearted, yet hard as nails hero of the jungle. Is he only here on Fortune Street for the banana-selling fruit stalls!?"
4564,"Wario: A slightly vulgar miscreant who rivals Mario whether he wants it or not. He has no idea of value, but will do anything to make a quick buck!"
4565,"Waluigi: A strange baddie who's fueled solely by the desire to oppose Luigi. His twisted ways are sure to upset everyone!"
4566,"Daisy: The bright and lively, if slightly tomboyish, Princess of Sarasaland. Now she's bringing her bubbling enthusiasm to Fortune Street."
4567,"Birdo: A fluttery-eyed, pouting, pink creature with a very unusual mouth that spews eggs!"
4568,"Diddy Kong: The one and only, long-tailed, red-hatted partner to Donkey Kong. He swings deftly around Fortune Street as if it were his jungle home."
4569,"Bowser Jr.: The mischievous, practical-joking son of Bowser. He's a chip off the old block and definitely not someone to be messed with!"
4570,"Slime: The quintessential quirky character of any Dragon Quest domain. Slimes are podgy and squishy and speak almost perfect “gooman”."
4571,"Princess Princessa: A noble princess dedicated to the restoration of her beloved Moonbrooke after its ruinous fall at the hand of monsterkind. She's here to earn gold to fund the reconstruction work."
4572,"Kiryl: A priest serving in Zamoksva who secretly covets Tsarevna Alena. He remains glued to her side, protecting her from harm with his magical mastery."
4573,"Yangus: A half-inching hoodlum from the sticky-fingered town of Pickham who dreams of becoming a thief among thieves. This is young Yangus, but he's as cor-blimey as ever!"
4574,"Angelo: A Templar Knight from Maella Abbey whose cool character is just as adept at winning over the ladies as winning on Fortune Street."
4575,"Platypunk: A duck-billed, dough-collecting Don's dogsbody. He and his Plob mob once attacked Slimenia, and the wound's still oozing now."
4576,"Bianca: A bit of a tomboy in her youth, Bianca has grown up to be a kind and gentle woman. But she still makes the odd daring move here and there!"
4577,"Alena: A tomboyish Tsarevna from Zamoksva who's snuck out to try her hand at Fortune Street! She's a little too impulsive to make a go of it, though."
4578,"Carver: Don't let this muscle-bound hulk's appearance deceive you. Carver is a gentle and feeling man. But can his carpentry skills build him a fortune on Fortune Street?"
4579,"Jessica: A well-to-do young lady from Alexandria. She's headstrong and bold, and won't give you any quarter whatsoever."
4580,"Dragonlord: The kingpin of monsterkind who would see the world plunged into darkness. True to his dastardly disposition, his shops are powerhouses of impoverishment that lurk around every bend to bring you to your knees."
4581,"Stella: A mysterious female who's all about appearances, devoted to fashion and definitely NOT a faer— She always does the first thing that enters her head, which might just win her the game!"
4582,"Patty: A networking pundit who the lonely adventurer can rely on to be behind the counter of her Party Planning Place whenever needed. When it comes to running a business, is there anyone better?"

5136,"What are the <dq>standard rules<dq>? The well-loved rules played by fans of the series since 1991. Dabble in stocks and dominate districts in a deeply devious game of commercial deftness!"
5137,"What are the <dq>easy rules<dq>? A simpler version of the game that absolutely anyone can enjoy. Buy shops, build them up, and bring it home in a bold, brisk game of business and bargaining!"
5138,"Aim to freeload! If you spot a competitor making a move that's likely to push up a district's stock prices, jump on the bandwagon and buy those stocks! This is an advanced business technique Fortune Streeters call “freeloading”!"
5139,"Use your inside knowledge! By investing capital into districts in which you own stock, you can make a profit from the stock price rise that follows. It's the fundamental way to make your stocks work for you. A shameless technique known as <dq>insider trading<dq>!"
5140,"Sidestep the stock price slide! If you sell ten or more of a district's stocks at any one time, the stock price will fall. Try to ensure you only ever sell a maximum of nine stocks in an area, and you'll steer clear of the crash!"
5141,"Slow those tycoons down! If you own stocks in the same district as one of your competitors, you can give their assets a knock by selling stocks in tens. Just be careful that you don't lose out more than the competition!"
5142,"Dig those dividends! Whenever a sale is made in districts in which you own stock, you receive a dividend. The dividend amount is divided up among the stock owners in proportion to how much each owns."
5143,"Keep buyouts at bay! Low-value shops are in real danger of being forcibly bought out. To avoid a buyout, invest capital in such shops as quickly as possible and up their value."
5144,"Forced buyout fees. If one of your shops is bought out from under you for five times its value, you'll sadly only see three times its value filling up your purse. The rest goes to the bank as an <dq>administration fee<dq>!"
5145,"Avail yourself of auctions! If you run out of ready cash and have no stocks, the bank will repossess property from you to cover your dues. But only at 75% of its value! So if you think you're about to hit the breadline, best to auction a shop before you roll the die."
5146,"Keep it comfortable! You can change the orientation of the Wii Remote in the options. Using it vertically, you can play the game with one hand."
5147,"Suit Yourself wisely! Suit Yourself cards can stand in for any suit, <mark_sp> <mark_ht> <mark_di> or <mark_cb>. If you're lucky enough to get hold of one, think carefully about which streets you travel down to get back to the bank."
