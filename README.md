# Disassembly
This repository contains the ghidra disassembly file and individual asm hacks for Fortune Street ST7P01

To use it you need to install ghidra and the gekko broadway language definition: https://github.com/aldelaro5/ghidra-gekko-broadway-lang

In ghidra you need to create a new non-shared project and then import the .gzf file.
